# Evan Dale Aromin

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Evan Dale Aromin and I â™¥ hacking software. I'm an Android Developer for the most
part of my career, but I've also worked on Python projects. Recently, I'm using
Node.js and Angular.js for web projects. I believe in using the right tool for
the job: a hammer for small problems and a bigger hammer for larger problems
because everything is just a nail. Heh, just kidding.

## What hardware do you use?

I use a mid-2011 Macbook Air 13" for personal projects and gaming. Yep, gaming. I don't
play games that much anymore, and the games I usually play aren't hardware intensive.
For Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2, I use a lesser loved desktop which I hardly ever turn
on. I'm planning to upgrade to a 2013 Macbook Retina Pro once it becomes available in
the PH, so that I can ditch my desktop. At work I use a mid-2012 Macbook Pro 13".

![Model M](https://raw.github.com/avendael/use/master/model_m.jpg)
I'm a huge mechanical keyboard fan. When I was younger I used to have an IBM Model M,
but I was too young to realize the legend that is the Model M. Now that I'm older,
I bought a Model M from [clickykeyboards](http://clickykeyboards.com) and became a
happier man. I feel nostalgic everytime I type on this keyboard, which is why I avoid
using it when I want to concentrate on doing work.

![Model F](https://raw.github.com/avendael/use/master/model_f.jpg)
The first keyboard I used was an IBM Model F from an old XT PC. It uses the same
buckling spring mechanism as the Model M, but has capacitive contacts instead of
membrane contacts, which gives it a lighter feel. I got this keyboard from ebay because
the old Model F our family used to own suffered the same fate as our old Model M.
I barely use this keyboard because of the weird layout, and I don't even feel nostalgic
when using it because I was too young when I first used a Model F.

![HHKB and Magic Mouse](https://raw.github.com/avendael/use/master/hhkb_and_mm.jpg)
HHKB Pro 2 is my daily driver. I bring it with me everyday. While I like the feel of
topre switches and the layout of the HHKB, I still prefer clicky switches. This one
has no labels because I like the way it looks, and I can type without looking at the
keyboard anyway. I type fastest on buckling springs (~100wpm) followed by topres
(~90wpm) making this my second favorite keyboard.

I barely use a mouse when I'm working, but if I do, I use a Magic Mouse.

![G700](https://raw.github.com/avendael/use/master/g700.JPG)
For gaming, I use a Logitech G700.

I also have a Logitech Trackman Marble, but I find it hard to use on OSX because it
lacks buttons for scrolling, switching desktops, and mission control. It's also less
configurable compared to the Magic Mouse and the G700.

Because I'm primarily an Android Developer, I can't get away without my own Android
device. Testing in an emulator is fine as long as you are testing on a phone-like
emulator with Android version not greater than ~2.3. Tablet emulators with Android
versions >= 3.0, however, are unbearable. I got myself the first version of Nexus 7 to
take care of this problem. At work, we have even more devices that we use for testing.
But now that [Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/) is released, I'm not planning to
invest on test devices anytime soon. I'll write more about it in the next section.

I deal with Android devices most of the time at work, so I use an iPhone as my personal
phone for a change.

## And what software?

![Emacs](https://raw.github.com/avendael/use/master/emacs_icon.png)

I use Emacs for almost everything. I hardly ever use a terminal because I can run shells
inside Emacs. Plain old `shell` usually does the trick, but I sometimes use `ansi-term`
for stuff that require ansi compatibility. What I like about `shell` is its `TRAMP`
integration. I ssh into a remote machine with the usual `C-x C-f`, and then `M-x shell`
to have a shell in that remote machine. For personal task lists I use `org-mode` which
also has a nice iOS app. I hardly ever use Finder because of `dired`, and I hardly ever
use Preview because emacs can open images and pdfs. For email, I use `gnus`, but at work
I use Mail.

For Android and other Java stuff, I use IntelliJ. I'm patiently waiting for the day
when Emacs can finally match up to IntelliJ in terms of Java. I used to use `jdee` in
Emacs, but IntelliJ is the superior tool.

Ever since Genymotion was introduced to me, I started using emulators more. It's really
fast, even faster than Android emulators using Intel HAX.

While I don't do much art, I use Pixelmator for programmer art and for creating 9gag
posts.

For shell scripts, I either use Python or Bash. I'm tried to use Node.js to write
shell scripts, but I still find Python and Bash to be the superior tool for this use
case.

I used to use Django for web stuff, but recently switched to Node.js because it makes
so much sense for the web. Let's Javascript everything! If one day Javascript came
close to native mobile app performance, I'll gladly use it to create my apps. As of now
I still code mobile apps in whatever native language the OS supports primarily because
their APIs are moving targets, and it's easier to optimize both for speed and memory
usage using a native language.

## What would be your dream setup?

For my dream keyboard, I want an Ergodox with either topres or buckling springs,
an hhkb with buckling springs. My dream laptop would have topres instead of scissor
switches, huge SSD and RAM capacity, whatever discrete graphics card is hip, and a
CPU that has Bitcoin mining mode so that I don't have to buy a separate ASIC Bitcoin
miner.
